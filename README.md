Create a class named FormLetterWriter that includes two overloaded methods named displaySalutation(). The first method takes one String parameter that represents a customerâ€™s last name, and it displays the salutation Dear Mr. or Ms. followed by the last name. The second method accepts two String parameters that represent a first and last name, and it displays the greeting Dear followed by the first name, a space, and the last name. After each salutation, display the rest of a short business letter: Thank you for your recent order. Write a main() method that tests each overloaded method. Save the file as FormLetterWriter.java.

Create a class named Billing that includes three overloaded computeBill() methods for a photo book store.

When computeBill() receives a single parameter, it represents the price of one photo book ordered. Add 8% tax, and return the total due.

When computeBill() receives two parameters, they represent the price of a photo book and the quantity ordered. Multiply the two values, add 8% tax, and return the total due.

When computeBill() receives three parameters, they represent the price of a photo book, the quantity ordered, and a coupon value. Multiply the quantity and price, reduce the result by the coupon value, and then add 8% tax and return the total due.

Write a main() method that tests all three overloaded methods. Save the application as Billing.java.
